# Kgotso Makhalimele - Bitnine Algorithms Coding Challenge

This repository contains solutions to the Bitnine coding challenges for questions 6-1 to 6-3.

## Challenges

### Question 6-1: Palindrome Checker

- File: `palindrome.py`
- Description: Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, return it in reverse order.

#### Usage (Python)

To run the palindrome checker:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kgotsosm/bitnine-algos.git`
2. Navigate to the `bitnine-algos` directory.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Run the command: `python palindrome.py`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a word and check if it's a palindrome.

### Question 6-2: Missing Number Finder

- File: `missingNum.js`
- Description: Given an array of the first 45 numbers with one missing number, find the missing integer.

#### Usage (JavaScript)

To find the missing number in JavaScript:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kgotsosm/bitnine-algos.git`
2. Navigate to the `bitnine-algos` directory.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Run the command: `node missingNum.js`
5. The missing number from the provided array will be displayed in the console.

### Question 6-3: Digital Clock

- File: `clock.js`
- Description: Javascript based digital clock.

#### Usage (JavaScript)

To run the digital clock in JavaScript:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kgotsosm/bitnine-algos.git`
2. Navigate to the `bitnine-algos` directory.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Run the command: `node clock.js`
5. The digital clock will start displaying the current time.

The clock can be made dynamic by linking it to an html file and dynamically rendering the time every second.
